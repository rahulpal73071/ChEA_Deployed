          {q:"Myself",          a:"Hi, I am Anushka Khowala, 4th year student from the Chemical department. I interned in Hindustan Unilever over the summer in the R&D domain."},
          {q:"What was your motivation for the internship and what was the recruitment process like?",        a:"I was curious about how research works in the FMCG space and wanted to explore that side of things. The recruitment process was quite straightforward. We applied for the IAF with our resumes and a form. Almost everyone got selected for a basic aptitude and logical reasoning test alongwith a Hirevue interview. After that, around 10 people were shortlisted for interviews. Many people were waitlisted but they never opened up the waitlist. My interview was mostly HR-based along with some technical questions around one of my core projects."},
          {q:"Can you explain your role in the internship? What jobs were you expected to perform and what projects were you involved with?",                       a:"I worked on building an AI tool to assist with surfactant formulation. My main job was to create machine learning models that could predict properties like viscosity and mildness, and then build an interactive assistant using agentic AI. I got to work on everything — data, models, backend, frontend — basically the entire pipeline. I was in touch with many different stakeholders, but was also given a lot of freedom to lead the project and figure out how to make it work."},
          {q:"What were the most exciting aspects of the internship? What were the most challenging aspects?",             a:"The most exciting part was seeing the real impact of my work. I got to demo the tool to senior leaders at HUL and their feedback was super encouraging. It was satisfying to know that something built in just a few weeks could actually be useful in the long run. The biggest challenge was learning everything from scratch — I had no prior experience in ML or agentic AI. But what made it easier was getting to learn directly from experienced people at HUL rather than relying on tutorials or books."},
          {q:"What was the culture like in your office? How did the company treat the interns and what were you provided with?",               a:"I was at the Bangalore R&D centre and honestly, the culture surprised me. I expected a more formal, corporate vibe, but it was actually really warm and welcoming. People were approachable and always happy to help, no matter how senior or busy they were."},
          {q:"What were your key learnings from the internship?",           a:"I got to see how R&D directly helps solve real-world problems and how companies are starting to use AI in a smarter, more integrated way. It also made me more curious about research and innovation as a whole."},

          {q:"Myself",                 a:"Heyy all! I’m Prashabdhi, a fourth-year undergraduate from the Chemical Engineering department at IIT Bombay. I recently completed an 8-week internship at Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) as a Supply Chain Intern under the Unilever Leadership Internship Program (ULIP). You’ve probably heard of (and used) brands like Taj Mahal Tea, Bru Coffee, Vaseline . Yes, HUL is the FMCG giant behind these household names. So, why did I choose to intern in the FMCG sector? If you're currently debating which domain to explore or whether FMCG is the right fit for you, you're not alone, I had the same questions. In this blog, I’ll take you through my entire journey: from the application and interview process all the way to what it was actually like working at HUL."},
          {q:"What was your motivation for the internship and what was the recruitment process like?",                   a:"So like any other third-year student, I started off by making 3–4 different versions of my resume, tailored for profiles like Product Management, Supply Chain (FMCG), and a few others. At that point, I wasn’t targeting any specific domain. For preparation, I focused on general HR questions, reviewed my resume thoroughly (multiple times!), and gave mock interviews with friends. After getting shortlisted for HUL, I immediately reached out to seniors to understand the next rounds of the process. There were two rounds: one HireVue video interview, and one final HR interview. In the HireVue round, you’re asked a set of questions which appear on the screen, you get 2–3 minutes to prepare, and then you have to record your answer. The questions can range from personality-based to domain-specific. In my case, I was asked something related to the Supply Chain domain. Once you submit your responses, they’re reviewed by the company, and then a final shortlist is released for the interview round. The final interview, in my experience, was pretty chill. It lasted about 30 minutes and was more of a conversation than a typical grilling session. We spoke about my resume, my interests, and why I was excited to work at HUL. They didn’t ask anything too core-chemical specific, but I’d still suggest being ready with 1–2 topics from your core field just in case. Some interviewers do like to go there. The interview isn’t meant to trap you - it’s more of a discussion to understand if you're a good fit for the role, which demands accountability, ownership, leadership, and a quick grasp of the company and its functioning. For the interview, my prep mainly involved going through my resume in depth - every project, internship, and POR I had listed. I also made sure to check out the company’s website and understand their values, especially things like leadership, sustainability, and purpose-driven growth. If you’ve done all this, you’re good to go."},
          {q:"Can you explain your role in the internship? What jobs were you expected to perform and what projects were you involved with?",                           a:"I worked in the Supply Chain domain, and my project revolved around energy reduction, cost optimization, and CO2 emission reduction - essentially contributing to HUL’s broader sustainability goals. Each intern is assigned a tutor, buddy, and coach, with the tutor being your main point of contact throughout the internship. In some cases, you might need to reach out to your tutor before the internship begins to understand your project charter, which is usually shared about a week in advance. The internship kicked off with all of us ULIPs bonding over our shared struggles with Mumbai locals. We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott in Andheri for two days of induction. After that, everyone moved to their respective stint locations. Since my posting was at the Mumbai Head Office, I was allotted a guesthouse in Wadala along with other co-interns. After the first day of induction, you get to meet your tutor if they are based in the same Mumbai Head office. The first two weeks are mostly about understanding your project scope, identifying the key stakeholders, and creating a roadmap for execution. HUL really encourages you to think creatively, challenge existing systems, and come up with innovative solutions. The work culture also promotes open communication, so reaching out to anyone, regardless of hierarchy, is welcomed. Being at the Head Office, I often used Microsoft Teams and Outlook to connect with people at various factories and understand the finer details of my project from them. After four weeks, we had a mid-review with our tutors, coaches, and the tutors’ managers. The aim was to assess how well we understood our project, how deeply we had explored the related concepts, and what our plan was for completing it. I was handling three projects simultaneously, which was, not going to lie, a bit hectic, but also incredibly rewarding. I got to explore a wide range of topics and gained diverse insights. I also had the opportunity to visit two factories in Amli and Dapada, and honestly, I had the best time there! My main stakeholders were factory engineers and utility executives, but for one of my projects, I also worked with external stakeholders like TCS, Thermax, Cotopaxi etc. I even visited Thermax to understand their operations better, which added another dimension to my learning. By the seventh week, you’re expected to wrap up your projects and prepare for your final presentation. This is where you present your work to your tutor and other stakeholders. Based on this presentation and overall performance, they decide whether to offer you a Pre Placement Interview (PPI). After that, if you’re selected, there are two rounds of interviews - the first with General Managers of the Supply Chain team, and the second with the Executive Director of Supply Chain. Based on these rounds, the Pre Placement Offers (PPOs) are rolled out. These final rounds are quite selective and are used to filter out candidates."},
          {q:"What were the most exciting aspects of the internship? What were the most challenging aspects?",         a:"One of the things I was most excited about was diving into the world of corporate jargon and systems - understanding how a large company like HUL operates from the inside. But what truly made the experience memorable were the bonds I built with my co-interns. We shared our roadblocks, gave each other updates, and basically lived together for those 8 weeks. From debating over what to eat in the company cafeteria while sticking to our budgets, to taking cabs in the morning and catching locals in the evening to save money (and escape traffic), these small moments became some of my favorite memories from the internship. When it came to the project itself, the excitement grew as it gradually unfolded. In the first week, things might feel a bit fuzzy since you’re still getting used to the environment, the terminologies, and figuring out the exact scope of your project. But as time passes, everything starts falling into place. You begin to understand what you’re really working on, who your key stakeholders are, where you might need to travel, and how you’ll eventually conclude your project. Your tutor plays a crucial role throughout. They guide you not just on the project direction, but also on how to approach problems, what frameworks to use, and how to structure your solutions better. You’re also assigned a coach, you typically meet them two or three times during the internship. But those conversations can be incredibly eye-opening. For me, every meeting with my coach gave me a completely new perspective and pushed me to refine my thinking. It helped me unlock deeper layers of the problem and explore more innovative directions. One thing you should be prepared for: your project goals or deliverables may change midway through the internship. And that’s okay. By then, you’ll already have built a strong foundation, and adapting becomes part of the learning process. HUL really encourages this kind of flexible and solution-driven thinking. It’s about how you continue to communicate, re-evaluate, and align with your stakeholders. In just eight weeks, you’re expected to understand your project, interact with diverse stakeholders, develop solutions, and deliver outcomes. It’s a lot - but it’s also incredibly rewarding. I personally got to apply some core chemical engineering concepts, while also learning about energy efficiency, sustainability practices, and managerial decision-making. It was a perfect blend of my technical background and managerial exposure, and I could see how much the company values accountability, ownership, and initiative. Of course, no internship is without its challenges. Since I was based in the Mumbai Head Office, but my project was deeply factory-oriented, one major roadblock was coordinating with factory personnel - they’re extremely busy, and it’s tough to get hold of them. But with consistent follow-ups and clear communication, I eventually built strong working relationships. Another challenge some interns might face is that tutors can be very busy too. That’s where your own drive to learn comes in. How consistent you are, how proactive you are in communicating, and how eager you are to grow, all of that plays a huge role in making the most out of this internship. Even though the official timings were from 9 to 5, many of us in the Head Office stayed back until 7 or even 8 in the evening because that’s when stakeholders were finally free. But in the end, all those extra hours, challenges, and roadblocks were absolutely worth it. I walked away with a deeper understanding of the company, its people, and its purpose and a lot of personal growth along the way."},
          {q:"What was the culture like in your office? How did the company treat the interns and what were you provided with?",         a:"Since I was based at the Mumbai Head Office, I spent most of my time on the Supply Chain floor and let me tell you, it’s a seriously high-energy space. The people there are constantly busy, working from around 9 AM to 6 PM, often juggling multiple tasks, coordinating not only within the office but also with 27 different factories across the country. It was in this fast-paced environment that I truly understood how demanding and critical supply chain operations are. Supply chain is the heartbeat of factory operations, and witnessing that first-hand was eye-opening. As an intern though, I never felt like I was out of place. In fact, everyone was incredibly welcoming. The moment you introduce yourself as a ULIP intern, people are very kind to help. They’re genuinely interested in your project, and will guide you on whom to reach out to- whether it’s a senior in a factory, someone from your own college, or another stakeholder in the company. My tutor and other stakeholders were extremely supportive. They shared all the data, materials, and context I needed to make progress. Any time I was stuck, I never hesitated to reach out - and I always got help. One of the most wholesome things about the Mumbai office is this little tradition that everyone follows - post-lunch walks. The head office is designed like a modern open mall, with wide hallways, natural light, and little brand stalls like Bru Coffee and Magnum Ice Creams. After lunch, teams casually go for a walk around the building, usually four to five rounds and then head back to work. These small rituals made us interns feel like we were part of something bigger. We weren’t just visitors for eight weeks, we were immersed in the culture, and that made the experience all the more fulfilling."},
          {q:"What were your key learnings from the internship?",         a:"One of my biggest takeaways from the internship was personal growth and self-development. In college, we’re not really used to having a fixed routine but when you’re working at a company like Hindustan Unilever, that changes. You’re expected to stick to a schedule, be accountable, and report your progress regularly to stakeholders. This shift taught me to take ownership of my work, manage my time better, and deliver on deadlines, all while juggling multiple priorities. Over the course of those eight weeks, I developed a genuine drive to understand my project in depth. I found myself diving into research, applying concepts I had learned in my chemical engineering courses, and developing quick problem-solving skills to keep up with the pace. One of my key learnings was the importance of exploring multiple approaches to a problem- the company actively encourages you to think out of the box and propose innovative, practical solutions. Another major learning was the value of open communication. There were many times I didn’t fully understand something and I realized that simply talking to people around me often led to the fastest and most helpful answers. You’re never expected to know everything. Even asking the most basic questions can lead to meaningful insights. Being transparent and communicative with your tutor, stakeholders, and peers was something I learned to prioritize and value. On the technical front, I went from barely knowing how the supply chain works to gaining a comprehensive understanding of how FMCG factories operate - from procurement and production to delivery. I also learned how a massive organization like HUL functions at the head office level, how decisions are made, how cross-functional teams work together, and how structured the internal processes are."},

I recently completed my summer internship at Deutsche Bank as a Software Developer, and the journey was full of learning, growth, and real-world challenges."},
          {q:"What was your motivation for the internship and what was the recruitment process like?",               a:"I was keen on exploring how software development drives innovation and efficiency in the financial world. Deutsche Bank offered to me the perfect platform to apply my technical skills in a high-impact, real-world environment. The recruitment process began with a coding test that included DSA problems and MCQs based on core computer science subjects. The test was followed by three rounds of interviews: Round 1: Technical interview involving data structures, algorithms, and resume discussion Round 2: Professional fit check round to assess how well I would align with the team and work culture Round 3: HR round focused on behavioral questions and long-term aspirations Each round tested different aspects. My advice to juniors would be to just stay confident and focus on showcasing qualities such as problem-solving, clarity of thought, and the willingness to learn."},
          {q:"Can you explain your role in the internship? What jobs were you expected to perform and what projects were you involved with?",                          a:"My role was as a Software Developer in the Corporate Bank division at Deutsche Bank Pune, where I worked on developing an internal enterprise platform called ReleasePilot—an AI-powered, centralized release management solution aimed at automating and transforming the highly manual and fragmented enterprise release process. My Role & Responsibilities: As part of the development team, I contributed across the full stack, combining backend automation with frontend design and ML pipeline integration. My key responsibilities included: -implementation of core backend microservices using Python, designed to fetch real-time updates from systems like Jira and internal change management tools. -Development of REST APIs to serve key functionalities like SDLC document generation, audit trail logging, and automated scheduling. -Integration of AI-powered features, such as smart tagging of documents, predictive risk alerts, and dependency mapping."},
          {q:"What were the most exciting aspects of the internship? What were the most challenging aspects?",       a:"In my opinion, the most exciting aspect was the blend of AI, finance and software. The project I worked on combined AI-powered automation with traditional software engineering in a financial domain. I got to explore natural language extraction from emails and auto-tagging of documents, both of which were fun and intellectually stimulating. Most Challenging Aspects: I don't think anything was that difficult in these 2 months. Having said that, coming from a tech background with no prior experience in finance, understanding the domain-specific requirements—especially around SDLC compliance, audit trails, and release governance—was initially tough, though I did get the hang of it eventually."},
          {q:"What was the culture like in your office? How did the company treat the interns and what were you provided with?",          a:"Deutsche Bank truly went above and beyond to ensure that our 2-month internship experience was as smooth and comfortable as possible. From day one, the focus was not only on allowing us to learn but also on making us feel valued and welcomed. We were provided with a one-week stay at the 5-star Hyatt Regency, which made the onboarding phase extremely smooth and luxurious. For the entire duration of the internship, daily cab facilities were arranged for pick-up and drop-off, ensuring convenience and safety. The office environment was vibrant and supportive, with unlimited tea, coffee, and snacks available throughout the day, keeping our energy up. On top of that, we received some amazing intern goodies including a high-end headset, a Deutsche Bank t-shirt and a Laptop Briefcase. The culture was a perfect blend of professionalism and care. Everyone—from managers to full-time employees—was approachable and genuinely interested in helping us grow. The company made sure that even though it was a short two-month stint, we walked away with a meaningful experience both professionally and personally."},
          {q:" What were your key learnings from the internship?",          a:"I learnt that real-world software isn’t just about writing code—it’s about solving actual problems, collaborating with teams, and building things that people can rely on. I also understood how important communication, ownership, and curiosity are in a corporate setup.Most importantly, I came out more confident, both as a developer and as a team player."},

          {q:"Myself",                  a:"Hi! I’m Radhika, a fourth-year Chemical Engineering student. I hail from Jaipur. I enjoy playing sports, dancing, and travelling whenever I get the chance 😊. I recently completed an eight-week internship at Procter & Gamble in their Supply Chain division. In this blog, I’ll share my experience at P&G, what it was like working there, and the things I learned along the way. I’ll also talk about my overall experience with the intern season—how the process typically works and what my own journey looked like. Whether you're just starting to prep or somewhere in the middle of the chaos, I hope this helps you get a clearer picture of what to expect!"},
          {q:"What was your motivation for the internship and what was the recruitment process like?",            a:"Up until my second year, I actually liked core chemical engineering. In fact, I ended up taking a research project in my 4th semester under a professor whose course I really enjoyed. Soon after, I did an R&D internship at a plant that was related to that project. So, I had a decent amount of exposure to how research in chemical engineering really works—what it looks like in labs and how it translates in industry. Of course, that wasn’t enough for me to understand everything—but, it was enough for me to realize that research wasn’t something I saw myself doing in the long term. Hence, I was left feeling pretty clueless—I didn’t know what path to go down next. So, I started doing what most of us do when we’re lost—I talked to seniors. A lot of them. I asked them about their intern experiences, how they chose their fields, what they liked or regretted. Through all these conversations, I slowly started ruling things out. Consulting felt too hectic for my liking, I didn’t really have a finance background and core no longer appealed to me. I was left with FMCG, which seemed like something I could maybe try. To be honest, at this point, getting an internship felt more important than getting one in my “ideal” field—because I genuinely didn’t know what I liked yet. So, I applied everywhere. P&G was the first company whose process I got involved in. Their selection process had two tests—the PEAK Performance Assessment, which is a situational judgment test focusing on behavioural and work styles, and another interactive one that tested cognitive skills like logical reasoning, numerical aptitude, and memory. To prepare, I followed Bahroz Abbas’s YouTube channel and took notes on all his tips. I also spoke to a lot of seniors to understand all the little tricks and strategies. This was enough to do well. At the same time, consult shortlists were also being released, and there were tests for some companies. I had a decent number of shortlists across consult, FMCG, and finance. I began prepping seriously for consult cases. Those two weeks after getting shortlisted were really hectic—but I genuinely enjoyed the process. I got to interact with a lot of new people and that was pretty exciting. The buddies assigned are actual consultants, with a pretty hectic schedule packed with work and travel. I remember doing cases with them at 2 a.m., sometimes while they were at airports or between client calls. It felt intense, and while I learned a lot, there was a part of me that felt uneasy. Watching their lives up close made me question whether I’d be okay with that kind of work-life balance. But at that point, I didn’t have the luxury to be picky. I wasn’t sure about what I wanted, so I just kept going with the prep, hoping it would eventually lead somewhere. In between all of this, I got the P&G GD shortlist, with just one day to prepare. I went back to the same youtube channel, watched everything I could, and somehow squeezed it in between all the consult prep. The GD was my first professional interview ever, and I remember being super nervous. But, I managed to give it confidently. I got through to the final round interview, which was scheduled for Day 1. After the GD, I doubled down on consult prep again. But even after practicing so many cases, I still didn’t feel confident. And then came D-Day. I remember just running around the LHC the entire time, giving back-to-back interviews. It was honestly really intense and exhausting. But things started going downhill pretty quickly. I got rejected by two MBB firms, and that hit my confidence hard. For the next two interviews, I ended up arriving late, and it felt like the interviewers weren’t even interested—it was more of a formality. By the end of it, I was rejected by all four consult firms I had interviews with that day. I still remember sitting outside LHC, watching everyone go out for lunch, celebrating their offers, and I was just sitting there with this heavy, sinking feeling. It was honestly one of the worst days I’ve ever had. But I didn’t even get the time to process it properly, because I still had P&G left. Coming back from that mess of a day and starting prep for P&G again has to be one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. What really got me through this was the support from my friends and I am really grateful for that. I had one finance interview the next morning, which I wanted to skip in order to focus on P&G but I couldn’t leave it because that would lead to a penalty. So I went, wrapped it up quickly, and came back to prepare for P&G. The final interview at P&G was short—just 15 minutes. They mostly asked me why I wanted to work there. I gave the interview, and from there, all I could do was wait. And thankfully, I got the offer. But with this experience, I’d say, you need a strong support system around you, because when things go wrong—these are the people who’ll pull you out and motivate you to keep going. Because sometimes, you don’t even get the time to process things—you just have to start again, without any guarantee. Looking back, Day 1 felt like everything was falling apart. But now, I genuinely wouldn’t trade that experience for anything. I learned more in those 48 hours than I had in months. I learnt how to stay patient, keep putting in effort, and trust myself. This whole process gave me the confidence that If I could get through something like this once, I could do it again if something went wrong in future."},

What jobs were you expected to perform and what projects were you involved with?",                       a:"I worked in the operations team of the Baby Care department, which produces Pampers diapers. My project was all about digitising and gamifying the troubleshooting guides used on the production lines. Whenever there’s an unplanned stop, technicians need to follow a set of specific steps, in a particular order, to figure out the root cause and get the line running again. But this process can be pretty tedious and needs a lot of hands-on practice to get right. So, the goal of my project was to make this process smoother—by bridging the capability gap between technicians, helping them become more self-sufficient, and reducing their dependence on technical experts. To do that, I had to make the training process more engaging and interactive. I started by building the entire UI/UX—wireframing the layout, designing the user flow, setting up the scoring logic, and preparing all the backend data. After that, I created a clickable prototype to simulate how the app would actually work. Once everything looked good, I moved on to coding the final application. After building the app, I tested it on the production lines, took feedback from users, made tweaks wherever needed, and scaled it up as much as I could within the time I had. Towards the end, I also worked on a deployment plan and timeline so that P&G could actually roll it out and put it into action."},
          {q:"What were the most exciting aspects of the internship? What were the most challenging aspects?",                        a:"I was in the Babycare department, so I got to see how diapers and pads are actually made firsthand. The process is much more complex than I had imagined, and it made me realize how much detail and precision goes into the everyday products we use at home. One of the most exciting parts of my project was gamifying the training module. To make the experience interactive and engaging, I had to create a dynamic scoring logic for the app, complete with a leaderboard. It was both tricky and fun—especially because I enjoy working with numbers, so figuring out the logic really kept me hooked. The biggest challenge was the technical nature of the project. I’ve never been someone who enjoys coding, and I was expected to build a full training application from scratch, including the backend, UI/UX, and gamification features. I was quite nervous initially and even told my guide and sponsor that I had no prior coding experience. But once I got into the project and started breaking it down, things gradually became manageable. I also reached out to the digital team whenever I got stuck, and surprisingly, I started enjoying the process—it felt rewarding to solve problems in an area I never thought I’d be able to handle. Another challenge was that in the beginning, it was difficult to get people’s time—everyone is quite busy and interns don’t always get immediate attention. But over time, I was able to build a rapport with the technicians and experts. Eventually, I would sit with them while working, and we’d end up chatting, cracking jokes, and discussing random things. That sense of camaraderie made the whole experience much more enjoyable. One of the most difficult parts of the internship for me were the mid-term and final presentations. Both these presentations were in front of 8–10 senior leaders from the company, and there were a lot of questions and discussions during the reviews. I remember during my final review, the plant manager suddenly asked me to start presenting from the end and go in reverse. It completely threw me off because I had prepared the flow in a specific way—and for the first five minutes, I was honestly quite nervous. It’s a little funny now, but in the moment, it was definitely overwhelming to say the least."},
          {q:"What was the culture like in your office? How did the company treat the interns and what were you provided with?",              a:"The office had a flat structure—everyone from Band 1 to Band 4 shared the same space, with no cabin culture. This made it easy to approach anyone, regardless of their role. What stood out to me was how willing people were to help. Many of them took time out of their own busy schedules to guide me, and I’m especially grateful to my buddy and guide, who were always there to support me throughout the internship."},
          {q:"What were your key learnings from the internship?",              a:"The internship was honestly a roller coaster. There were days I came back completely drained, especially when things didn’t go as planned or when I couldn’t figure certain things out despite trying really hard. When things go wrong, I tend to panic and put a lot of pressure on myself, and this experience really it to the surface. But it also helped me realise that I need to pause sometimes—to look back and acknowledge how much I’ve learnt, instead of constantly worrying about what lay ahead. Not every day has to be perfect. Some days are just off, and that’s okay. What matters most is the intent and effort one consistently puts in. It also pushed me to reflect on myself in ways I hadn’t expected. I became aware of habits and patterns I need to work on. Internships have a way of showing you what you’re not good at—and that can be uncomfortable. But it’s also how you grow. What’s important is being honest with yourself, taking responsibility, and actively working on those gaps. No one has it all figured out, and that’s okay!You should give this your 100%, regardless of the outcome. The satisfaction you feel from knowing that you genuinely tried often means more than the final result. This internship was the first time I had complete ownership over something—from start to finish. And that sense of responsibility and leadership gave me a kind of satisfaction I’d never felt before. And one last thing—luck is real. I used to dismiss it, but I’ve seen how sometimes, despite all efforts, things just don’t go your way. It can feel unfair, but I think it evens out in the long run. Everyone has their share of setbacks. So let go of what you can’t control, and try to find contentment in what you do have. That mindset has helped me more than anything else."},

      "q": "What was your motivation for the internship and what was the recruitment process like?",
      "a": "Just as everyone else, I too was very confused between multiple domains. Consulting, Finance, Core, Software, it all felt so overwhelming. Eventually, I started rejecting options, finally ending up with this decision. I had a good CPI, but no PoRs, something that is quite important for consulting. As far as finance was concerned, I didn't find it that interesting. I was only left with core and software. I was shortlisted for companies like BASF and HUL, but was rejected in both. Fortunately, I had devoted a large part of my 2nd year summer break to DSA, which is one of the most important topics for software roles in Big MNCs. I gave OAs for day 1 companies like Uber, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft but did not have any luck due to their preference for CSE students. Linkedin came to campus on week 2 and was open for all branches. Around 550 students gave the OA, which was completely based on DSA (3 questions, 1.5 hours). Only those who solved all 3 were shortlisted. The interview had 2 virtual rounds: 1. Technical round (50 mins) involving an easy Leetcode (move zeros) and a medium-hard one (topological sort). 2. HM (Hiring Manager) round: Taken by a senior manager, focusing on projects and leadership skills. It was very chill and lasted 30 mins. For prep, I focused on the Blind 75 sheet and A-Z Striver sheet (Sliding window, DP, Graphs) on Leetcode; I didn't do CP."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can you explain your role in the internship? What jobs were you expected to perform and what projects were you involved with?",
      "a": "My role was as a software engineering intern. All interns were assigned very impactful projects, with many sending code to production in the first few weeks. My project didn't involve standard backend/frontend (CRUD) work; instead, I worked on an internal tool to be used by other developers at LinkedIn. This was challenging and involved a deeper understanding of the codebase. I had to write tests and optimize my code using LinkedIn built tools. It was a great learning experience, very different from traditional software projects."

There were weekly events like VP talks, perfume making, Lego building, aqua zumba, and trips to Dave & Busters. We had full autonomy over our office hours and leaves as long as we delivered. The challenge was that my project felt complicated and unconventional initially, partly due to my non-CSE background and lack of dev knowledge. However, I learned from my mistakes and successfully delivered the project."

There was no ego hierarchy; despite being an intern, I could easily reach out to senior folks who were always happy to help."
    },
    {
      "q": "What were your key learnings from the internship?",
      "a": "1. I gained a new perspective on real software projects, learning LLD design and how to deploy code in a complex ecosystem. 2. I realized that with AI, actual coding is less than 10% of the challenge. A large chunk of time is actually spent collaborating with other engineers (including those in the US) and managing interdependencies to get things done."

One cannot afford to be overly choosy regarding salary or brand names initially. However, remain wary of exploiters. The goal is to get a foot in the door, as labor markets eventually improve once the crisis settles."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which sectors currently offer the best opportunities for Chemical Engineers?",
      "a": "Pharmaceuticals, Healthcare, and Allied industries are witnessing growth even during global disruptions. Due to geopolitical shifts and the desire to move manufacturing bases to India (especially in Fine Chemicals), there is significant potential. Look for companies setting up new plants, factories, or lines of business, as these are the biggest hubs for new employment."
    },
    {
      "q": "How should one approach the job hunt in a challenging market?",
      "a": "Identify expanding companies indirectly through market research or directly by talking to investors and company heads. Target functions with high hiring probabilities for Chemical Engineers: Production, Project Management, Engineering, and Maintenance. To increase your chances, be flexible—for example, offer to work on a contract basis. Prepare for a harder cycle of networking, cold calling, and interviewing."

    {
      "q": "How did the 2008 recession and the Mumbai attacks affect your initial career path?",
      "a": "Our placement season was hit by both the global recession and the 26/11 attacks, which kept many MNCs away. I had aimed for top American Oil & Gas companies like Schlumberger or Transocean, but they didn't visit or only offered 'token' positions. I remained unplaced until March, eventually joining Ispat Industries (now JSW). I briefly considered being a Research Assistant or going for an MS, but family responsibilities and a personal preference for immediate employment led me to the steel industry."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can you describe your transition from the core sector to other fields like UPSC and teaching?",
      "a": "I worked in a steel plant for two years as a field engineer and R&D analyst, but the work culture and health conditions weren't a fit. In 2011, I quit to prepare for the UPSC/IAS exams in Delhi, supporting myself by teaching math to IIT aspirants. After two unsuccessful attempts and facing financial/mental strain, I decided to return to the corporate world, though I found that the Oil & Gas industry still hadn't evolved to accommodate someone with my specific gap in experience."
    },
    {
      "q": "How did you eventually break into the technology sector and Product Management?",
      "a": "It was a period of 'complete darkness.' I faced rejections and low-salary offers because I lacked an IT background. I briefly joined FIITJEE to secure a job, but kept looking for tech roles. Luckily, Times Internet hired me as an Analyst. I transitioned from Analyst to Technical Product Manager, discovering a passion for solving industry problems through technology. This journey led me to my current role at Bytedance."
    },
    {
      "q": "What kept you motivated through these significant setbacks and career shifts?",
      "a": "My family, a stern belief in a better future, and the support of IIT friends kept me going through multiple bouts of depression and failure. I came from a humble background—a Hindi-medium government school—so I was used to struggling. I believe that if situations go bad, it is to teach you something you were missing. Struggle is part and parcel of life; bad incidents shouldn't define your entire future."
    },
    {
      "q": "What advice do you have for students navigating the current pandemic or economic shifts?",
      "a": "Focus on strengths and stay hopeful. For those graduating now, options include: 1) Higher Studies or specialized online courses with high ROI. 2) Research Assistant roles on campus. 3) Teaching (EdTech platforms like BYJU'S or Vedantu). 4) MBA. Regarding industries, focus on gaming, streaming, e-commerce, healthcare, and fintech/martech. Avoid travel, hospitality, and consulting for the next few years as they recover."

I applied in my 4th semester after learning that 2nd year students could also go. For Chemical Engineering, the criteria include a CPI > 7 and no active backlogs. The process involves mapping IITB courses to the host university's curriculum and getting approvals from the Faculty Advisor, DUGC, and Dean IR. While DTU has an MoU that waives tuition fees, scholarships often require taking Biotechnology-specific courses."
      },
      {
        "q": "How did the academic environment at DTU differ from IIT Bombay?",
        "a": "The teaching methodology at DTU is quite different; there is a heavy emphasis on group work, projects, and assignments. Unlike the rigorous quiz and mid-semester culture at IIT, evaluation is primarily based on these group projects and a final exam. Coming from the intense academic background of an IIT, I found the academics manageable, which allowed more time for cultural exploration."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can you describe your living arrangements and the social life in Denmark?",
        "a": "I lived in 'Campus Village,' which consists of shipping containers converted into residential blocks. It was ideal for avoiding expensive public transport. DTU organizes an introductory week with parties, a gala dinner, and a trip to Copenhagen. I even participated in a Dragon Boat Festival. Living in close quarters with 'container mates' created a strong bond, especially during the lockdown when we shared meals, played games, and managed cleaning schedules together."
      },
      {
        "q": "How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact your exchange experience and travel plans?",
        "a": "The pandemic turned my travel plans from 'touring Europe' to 'walking to the supermarket.' However, before the lockdown, I managed to visit Sweden, Germany (to watch a Bayern Munich match), Belgium, and the Netherlands. When the lockdown hit, classes moved online and exams were conducted virtually. While the travel was restricted, the experience shifted toward personal growth, learning to cook, and exploring the local Danish summer and cycling culture once things slowly reopened."
      },
      {
        "q": "What were your key takeaways and how did you finally return to India?",
        "a": "The exchange gave me a new perspective on life and essential life skills like cooking and cleaning. Due to suspended flights, I had to return via a Vande Bharat Mission repatriation flight through Helsinki. Despite the pandemic, the experience was not ruined; it was bittersweet to leave the wonderful people I met. My advice to juniors: don't be afraid to pursue an exchange even if it seems like a long shot—it is a transformative personal journey."
